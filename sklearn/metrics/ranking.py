def log_loss(y_true, y_pred, eps=1e-15, normalize=True):
    """Log loss, aka logistic loss or cross-entropy loss.

    This is the loss function used in (multinomial) logistic regression
    and extensions of it such as neural networks, defined as the negative
    log-likelihood of the true labels given a probabilistic classifier's
    predictions. For a single sample with true label yt in {0,1} and
    estimated probability yp that yt = 1, the log loss is

        -log P(yt|yp) = -(yt log(yp) + (1 - yt) log(1 - yp))

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like or label indicator matrix
        Ground truth (correct) labels for n_samples samples.

    y_pred : array-like of float, shape = (n_samples, n_classes)
        Predicted probabilities, as returned by a classifier's
        predict_proba method.

    eps : float
        Log loss is undefined for p=0 or p=1, so probabilities are
        clipped to max(eps, min(1 - eps, p)).

    normalize : bool, optional (default=True)
        If true, return the mean loss per sample.
        Otherwise, return the sum of the per-sample losses.

    Returns
    -------
    loss : float

    Examples
    --------
    >>> log_loss(["spam", "ham", "ham", "spam"],  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    ...          [[.1, .9], [.9, .1], [.8, .2], [.35, .65]])

    """Compute ranking-based average precision

    Label ranking average precision (LRAP) is the average over each ground
    truth label assigned to each sample, of the ratio of true vs. total
    labels with lower score.

    This metric is used in multilabel ranking problem, where the goal
    is to give better rank to the labels associated to each sample.

    The obtained score is always strictly greater than 0 and
    the best value is 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples, n_labels]
        True binary labels in binary indicator format.

    y_score : array, shape = [n_samples, n_labels]
        Target scores, can either be probability estimates of the positive
        class, confidence values, or binary decisions.
